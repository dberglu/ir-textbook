#### 1. What is the primary purpose of Regulation Fair Disclosure (Reg FD)?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. To require public companies to disclose material information to all investors simultaneously
2. To mandate quarterly earnings guidance from all public companies
3. To establish accounting standards for financial reporting
4. To regulate trading activities of institutional investors
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **A**. Regulation Fair Disclosure (Reg FD) is an SEC rule requiring public companies to disclose material information to all investors simultaneously, preventing selective disclosure to favored analysts or institutional investors. Option B is incorrect as Reg FD does not mandate guidance. Option C describes GAAP/IFRS standards, not Reg FD. Option D relates to trading regulations, not disclosure requirements.

    **Concept Tested:** Regulation Fair Disclosure

    **Bloom's Level:** Remember

#### 2. Which SEC filing must be submitted within four business days of a material corporate event?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Form 10-Q
2. Form 10-K
3. Form 8-K
4. Proxy Statement (DEF 14A)
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. Form 8-K is a current report filed with the SEC to announce material events, typically within four business days of the triggering event. Form 10-Q (A) is filed quarterly, Form 10-K (B) is filed annually, and Proxy Statements (D) are filed before annual meetings. Only Form 8-K addresses immediate material events.

    **Concept Tested:** Form 8-K Summary

    **Bloom's Level:** Remember

#### 3. Under Sarbanes-Oxley Section 302, what must the CEO and CFO certify?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. That the company's stock price accurately reflects intrinsic value
2. That they have personally reviewed all investor communications
3. That they are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal controls and have evaluated their effectiveness
4. That the company will achieve its earnings guidance
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. SOX Section 302 requires the CEO and CFO to certify that they are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and internal controls, have evaluated their effectiveness, and have disclosed any deficiencies to auditors and the audit committee. Option A relates to valuation (not a regulatory requirement), Option B is impractical and not required, and Option D would create liability for forward-looking commitments.

    **Concept Tested:** SOX Section 302

    **Bloom's Level:** Understand

    **See:** [Section 2: Sarbanes-Oxley Act](index.md#2-sarbanes-oxley-act-sox-accountability-and-controls)

#### 4. What standard determines whether information is considered "material" for disclosure purposes?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Any information the CEO considers significant
2. Information specifically requested by the SEC
3. Only information that affects earnings per share by more than 5%
4. Information that a reasonable investor would consider important in making an investment decision
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **D**. Materiality is defined by the legal standard: whether a reasonable investor would consider the information important in making an investment decision. This "reasonable investor" test comes from Supreme Court precedent (TSC Industries v. Northway). Option A is subjective and not the legal standard. Option C applies an arbitrary quantitative threshold that doesn't capture the full materiality concept. Option D describes responsive disclosure, not the materiality standard.

    **Concept Tested:** Material Information

    **Bloom's Level:** Understand

    **See:** [Section 1: Regulation Fair Disclosure](index.md#1-regulation-fair-disclosure-reg-fd-the-foundation-of-equitable-disclosure)

#### 5. During a "blackout period," what activity is typically restricted?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. All external communications by the company
2. Dividend payments to shareholders
3. Filing of SEC reports
4. Trading of company securities by insiders and sharing of material nonpublic information
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **D**. Blackout periods are timeframes when insiders cannot trade company securities or share material nonpublic information, typically occurring before earnings announcements. Option A is too broad—companies can still make necessary disclosures. Option C is incorrect as SEC filings continue during blackout periods. Option D relates to dividend policy, not blackout periods.

    **Concept Tested:** Blackout Period Management

    **Bloom's Level:** Remember

    **See:** [Section 3: Insider Trading](index.md#3-insider-trading-regulations-and-blackout-periods)

#### 6. Your company is about to announce a major acquisition. An analyst calls requesting details before the public announcement. Under Reg FD, what should you do?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Decline to provide specifics until the information is publicly disclosed
2. Provide the information since analysts help disseminate news to investors
3. Provide information only if the analyst signs a confidentiality agreement
4. Provide high-level details but withhold specific financial terms
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **A**. Under Reg FD, you must decline to provide material nonpublic information selectively, even to analysts. The information must be publicly disclosed to all investors simultaneously through appropriate channels (press release, 8-K filing, public conference call). Option A violates Reg FD's prohibition on selective disclosure. Option C is insufficient—confidentiality agreements don't satisfy Reg FD's requirement for public disclosure. Option D still constitutes selective disclosure of material information.

    **Concept Tested:** Preventing Selective Disclosure

#### 7. What legal protection do "safe harbor provisions" provide for forward-looking statements?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Complete immunity from all lawsuits related to forward-looking statements
2. Automatic approval from the SEC for all future guidance
3. Guarantee that forward-looking statements cannot be used as evidence in court
4. Protection from liability if statements are made in good faith and accompanied by meaningful cautionary language
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **D**. Safe harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 protect forward-looking statements from liability if they are identified as forward-looking, accompanied by meaningful cautionary language about risks and uncertainties, and not made with actual knowledge of falsity. Option A is incorrect—safe harbor provides conditional protection, not absolute immunity. Option C mischaracterizes evidentiary rules. Option D is incorrect as safe harbor relates to litigation protection, not SEC approval processes.

    **Concept Tested:** Safe Harbor Provisions

    **Bloom's Level:** Understand

    **See:** [Section 2: Sarbanes-Oxley Act](index.md#2-sarbanes-oxley-act-sox-accountability-and-controls)

#### 8. Which of the following best describes the purpose of MD&A (Management's Discussion and Analysis)?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. To explain financial results, trends, and material events from management\'s perspective
2. To promote the company\'s products and competitive advantages
3. To provide management\'s opinion on the company\'s stock valuation
4. To forecast future stock prices and recommend buy/sell actions
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **A**. MD&A is a narrative section in SEC filings where management explains financial results, trends, liquidity, capital resources, and material events from their perspective, helping investors understand the numbers in context. Option A is inappropriate—management doesn't provide stock opinions in MD&A. Option B confuses MD&A with marketing materials. Option D is incorrect and would violate securities regulations.

    **Concept Tested:** MD&A Requirements

    **Bloom's Level:** Understand

    **See:** [Section 4: SEC Filing Requirements](index.md#4-sec-filing-requirements-10-k-10-q-and-8-k)

#### 9. What was a primary regulatory failure exposed by the Enron scandal?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Lack of requirements for quarterly earnings calls
2. Insufficient auditor independence and ineffective internal controls
3. Absence of insider trading regulations
4. No requirements for disclosing executive compensation
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The Enron scandal exposed critical failures in auditor independence (Arthur Andersen providing both audit and consulting services) and ineffective internal controls that failed to detect or prevent massive accounting fraud. This directly led to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Option A is incorrect—earnings calls were already common. Option C is wrong as insider trading rules existed but weren't the primary issue. Option D is incorrect as compensation disclosure requirements existed, though they were later strengthened.

#### 10. An employee accidentally shares material nonpublic information at a conference. Under Reg FD, what must the company do?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Nothing, since the disclosure was unintentional
2. Promptly make public disclosure of the same information, generally within 24 hours
3. Request that the conference attendees sign non-disclosure agreements
4. Wait until the next scheduled earnings call to address the information
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Reg FD requires that if material nonpublic information is disclosed unintentionally (non-intentional selective disclosure), the company must promptly make public disclosure of the same information, generally within 24 hours of discovering the disclosure. Option A is incorrect—even unintentional disclosures trigger Reg FD obligations. Option C doesn't satisfy public disclosure requirements. Option D violates the "promptly" requirement (24 hours for non-intentional disclosure).

    **Concept Tested:** Reg FD Compliance

#### 11. What is the primary difference between Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 10-K is filed quarterly while 10-Q is filed annually
2. 10-K requires audited financial statements while 10-Q financial statements are unaudited
3. 10-K is optional while 10-Q is mandatory
4. 10-K is for large companies while 10-Q is for small companies
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The primary difference is that Form 10-K (annual report) requires audited financial statements with independent auditor opinion, while Form 10-Q (quarterly report) contains unaudited financial statements reviewed but not audited. Both are mandatory SEC filings. Option A reverses the frequency. Option C is incorrect as both are mandatory. Option D is wrong—company size determines whether you're a filer, not which forms you file.

    **Concept Tested:** SEC Filing Requirements

    **Bloom's Level:** Understand

    **See:** [Section 4: SEC Filing Requirements](index.md#4-sec-filing-requirements-10-k-10-q-and-8-k)

#### 12. What key lesson does the Theranos case provide for IR professionals regarding technology claims?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Technology companies should avoid providing specific product details
2. Aggressive marketing is essential for attracting investors to technology ventures
3. Transparency, verifiability, and ethical obligations must govern communications about technology capabilities
4. IR professionals should rely solely on executive representations without independent verification
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. The Theranos case demonstrates that transparency, verifiability of claims, and ethical obligations must govern all investor communications, especially regarding technology capabilities. IR professionals have a duty to ensure claims can be substantiated. Option A is wrong—appropriate detail is important for informed investing. Option B dangerously prioritizes marketing over accuracy. Option D is the opposite of the lesson learned—IR must conduct due diligence, not blindly trust executive claims.

    **Concept Tested:** Theranos IR Ethics
