# Course Description

## Title

**AI for Investor Relations Transformation**

## Overview

In an era where artificial intelligence (AI), agentic systems, and data analytics are reshaping capital markets, the investor relations (IR) function is undergoing rapid transformation. This self-paced executive course equips senior leaders—especially Chief Data & AI Officers (CDAO), CFOs, and strategic advisors—with the frameworks, tools, and governance models required to lead AI-powered IR modernization efforts.

Built on **Wharton-caliber instructional rigor** and drawn from **Fortune 100 best practices**, the course explores how advanced AI—particularly generative and agentic architectures—can enhance investor communications, regulatory alignment, stakeholder analysis, and IR strategy. Through case studies, hands-on exercises, and applied projects, learners will build the strategic literacy and operational insight necessary to drive responsible and high-impact AI adoption in the IR domain.
