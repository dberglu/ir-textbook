## Potential Gaps and Enhancements (Minor)

### 1. **Quantitative Metrics (Optional Enhancement)**
While the course covers KPIs and dashboards, adding specific IR metrics could strengthen concept diversity:
- Investor ownership concentration metrics
- Trading volume analysis
- Analyst coverage metrics
- Peer valuation benchmarking

**Impact:** Would add 10-15 additional concepts
**Priority:** Low (current coverage is sufficient)

### 2. **Technology Vendor Landscape (Optional Enhancement)**
More specific mention of vendor categories could aid concept generation:
- IR platform providers (e.g., Q4, Nasdaq IR Intelligence)
- GenAI platforms (e.g., enterprise LLM providers)
- Sentiment analysis vendors
- Compliance monitoring tools

**Impact:** Would add 8-12 additional concepts
**Priority:** Low (can be addressed in learning graph taxonomy)

### 3. **Case Study Examples (Optional Enhancement)**
While mentioned in Course Design Philosophy, specific Fortune 100 case study topics could strengthen context:
- Crisis communication with AI assistance
- Earnings surprise management
- ESG disclosure automation
- Proxy season AI support

**Impact:** Would add 5-10 additional concepts
**Priority:** Low (case studies will emerge naturally in content development)
