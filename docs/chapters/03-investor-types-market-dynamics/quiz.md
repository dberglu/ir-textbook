#### 1. What is the primary distinction between buy-side and sell-side analysts?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Buy-side analysts work for investment banks while sell-side analysts work for asset managers
2. Buy-side analysts make recommendations for their own firms' portfolios while sell-side analysts publish research for external clients
3. Buy-side analysts focus on stocks while sell-side analysts focus on bonds
4. Buy-side analysts are regulated by the SEC while sell-side analysts are not
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Buy-side analysts work for asset managers (mutual funds, pension funds, hedge funds) and make investment recommendations for their own firms' portfolios. Sell-side analysts work for investment banks and broker-dealers, publishing research and recommendations for external clients. Option A reverses the relationship. Option C is incorrect—both can cover various asset classes. Option D is wrong as both are subject to SEC regulations.

    **Concept Tested:** Buy-Side Analysts, Sell-Side Analysts

#### 2. Which type of institutional investor is typically funded by commodity revenues or foreign exchange reserves?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Mutual Funds
2. Pension Funds
3. Hedge Funds
4. Sovereign Wealth Funds
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **D**. Sovereign Wealth Funds are government-owned investment vehicles typically funded by commodity revenues (oil, gas, minerals) or foreign exchange reserves. Examples include Norway's Government Pension Fund Global and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority. Mutual funds (A) are funded by individual investors, pension funds (B) by retirement contributions, and hedge funds (C) by wealthy individuals and institutions seeking alternative strategies.

    **Concept Tested:** Sovereign Wealth Funds

#### 3. What does "consensus estimates" refer to in the context of earnings expectations?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Aggregated forecasts from multiple financial analysts
2. The board of directors' earnings projections
3. The company's official earnings guidance
4. Historical average earnings from prior quarters
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **A**. Consensus estimates represent the aggregated forecasts from multiple financial analysts who cover a company, typically calculated as the mean or median of all analyst estimates for metrics like EPS and revenue. Option C describes guidance (which may differ from consensus). Option B is incorrect—boards approve strategy but don't publish earnings projections. Option D represents historical performance, not forward estimates.

    **Concept Tested:** Consensus Estimates

    **Bloom's Level:** Remember

#### 4. Your company has historically provided quarterly earnings guidance but is considering discontinuing this practice. What is a primary risk of guidance withdrawal?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. It guarantees a stock price decline
2. The SEC may impose penalties for changing disclosure practices
3. Investors and analysts may interpret withdrawal as signaling uncertainty or negative outlook
4. The company will be prohibited from making any forward-looking statements
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. Guidance withdrawal risks include investors and analysts interpreting the change as management signaling increased uncertainty, reduced visibility, or negative outlook—potentially leading to increased volatility and valuation pressure. Option A is too absolute—outcomes vary by company and context. Option B is incorrect—companies can change voluntary disclosure practices. Option D is wrong—companies can still make forward-looking statements under safe harbor provisions even without formal guidance.

#### 5. Which investor type is characterized by using leverage, derivatives, and diverse strategies to generate returns often uncorrelated with broader markets?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Retail Investors
2. Pension Funds
3. Mutual Funds
4. Hedge Funds
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **D**. Hedge funds are investment partnerships that use diverse strategies including leverage, short-selling, derivatives, and alternative investments to generate absolute returns often uncorrelated with traditional markets. Retail investors (A) typically use simpler buy-and-hold strategies. Pension funds (B) generally follow conservative, diversified approaches. Mutual funds (C) are subject to restrictions limiting leverage and derivatives use.

    **Concept Tested:** Hedge Funds

#### 6. A company reports Q2 EPS of $1.10 versus consensus of $1.05, then raises full-year guidance from $4.20-$4.40 to $4.40-$4.60. What strategy is this demonstrating?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Conservative guidance approach
2. Sandbagging tactics
3. Beat-and-raise strategy
4. Guidance withdrawal
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. This demonstrates a beat-and-raise strategy: exceeding earnings expectations (beat) and simultaneously increasing forward guidance (raise). This approach builds credibility and positive momentum. Option A (conservative) would set low expectations but not necessarily beat and raise. Option B (sandbagging) means setting very low guidance but doesn't capture the "raise" element. Option D is the opposite—this company is providing guidance, not withdrawing it.

    **Concept Tested:** Beat-and-Raise Tactics

    **Bloom's Level:** Apply

#### 7. What is the primary role of investment banks in the capital markets ecosystem?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Managing retirement assets for pension funds
2. Publishing independent research for retail investors
3. Regulating trading activities on stock exchanges
4. Underwriting securities offerings and providing advisory services
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **D**. Investment banks serve as intermediaries in capital markets, primarily underwriting securities offerings (helping companies raise capital through IPOs, debt issuances, follow-on offerings) and providing advisory services (M&A, strategic transactions). Option A describes pension fund managers. Option B partially describes sell-side research (which investment banks provide) but misses their core capital-raising role. Option C describes regulatory bodies like the SEC and FINRA, not investment banks.

#### 8. When setting earnings guidance ranges, what is a key consideration for determining range width?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Range width should reflect genuine business visibility and uncertainty
2. Narrower ranges always demonstrate confidence
3. Wider ranges always provide more credibility
4. All companies should use the same standard range width
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **A**. Range width should reflect the company's genuine business visibility and level of uncertainty. Companies with predictable business models (utilities, subscription services) can provide narrower ranges, while those with volatile or uncertain businesses (commodities, early-stage tech) should use wider ranges to avoid frequent revisions. Option C is incorrect—excessively wide ranges signal poor visibility and reduce guidance value. Option B is wrong—artificially narrow ranges invite misses and credibility damage. Option D ignores legitimate business model differences.

#### 9. Which type of investor typically makes investment decisions individually for personal accounts rather than on behalf of organizations?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Institutional Investors
2. Pension Funds
3. Retail Investors
4. Sovereign Wealth Funds
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. Retail investors are individual investors who purchase securities for personal accounts rather than institutions. They typically invest smaller amounts and make their own decisions (or work with financial advisors). Options A, B, and D all represent institutional investors—organizations investing large sums on behalf of clients or beneficiaries.

    **Concept Tested:** Retail Investors

    **Bloom's Level:** Remember

#### 10. Why is maintaining strong sell-side analyst coverage valuable for public companies?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Analyst reports guarantee stock price appreciation
2. Coverage increases visibility, liquidity, and credibility with institutional investors
3. Analysts are required by the SEC to cover all public companies
4. Analyst coverage eliminates the need for company-produced investor materials
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Strong sell-side analyst coverage provides multiple benefits: increased visibility (research reaches broad investor audiences), improved liquidity (coverage attracts trading interest), and enhanced credibility (third-party validation of business model and strategy). Option A is incorrect—coverage doesn't guarantee positive outcomes. Option C is wrong—analyst coverage is voluntary, not mandated. Option D is false—companies still need their own investor materials regardless of analyst coverage.
