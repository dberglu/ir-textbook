3. **Create Chapter Quizzes** - Use `quiz-generator` skill after content is generated

### High Priority
1. **Update Chapter 5** - Add detailed content on LLMs, RAG, fine-tuning, model quality
2. **Update Chapter 6** - Add prompt library examples and structured templates
3. **Populate Chapter 7** - Add sentiment analysis methodologies and datasets
4. **Populate Chapter 8** - Add predictive analytics applications and case studies
5. **Create Chapter 9** - New content on personalized engagement and digital twins
6. **Expand Chapter 15** - Forward-looking content on agentic ecosystems

### Medium Priority
1. **Update References** - Use `reference-generator` skill for each chapter
2. **Create MicroSims** - Interactive visualizations for complex concepts
3. **Update Learning Graph Viewer** - Ensure all 298 concepts are represented

## Implementation Notes

### Chapter Size Considerations

**Larger Chapters (>30 concepts):**
- Chapter 8 (38 concepts) - Predictive Analytics
  - Consider splitting into 8A and 8B if content becomes too dense
  - Current grouping is logical (forecasting + scenario modeling)

- Chapter 15 (34 concepts) - Future Outlook
  - Intentionally larger as it synthesizes emerging trends
  - Forward-looking nature allows for broader scope

**Smaller Chapters (< 15 concepts):**
- Chapter 6 (8 concepts) - AI Content Creation
  - Appropriate size given focused topic
  - Quality over quantity for content creation workflows

- Chapter 5 (12 concepts) - AI/ML Fundamentals
  - Intentionally concise to avoid overwhelming learners
  - Provides foundation for later chapters

### Dependency Management

All concept dependencies have been validated:
- Foundational concepts (0 dependencies) appear in early chapters
- Intermediate concepts (1-2 dependencies) in middle chapters
- Advanced concepts (3+ dependencies) in later chapters
- Chapter progression respects prerequisite relationships

### Content Generation Strategy

When using `chapter-content-generator` skill:

1. **Generate in sequence** (Ch 1 → Ch 15) to maintain consistency
2. **Reference earlier chapters** for prerequisite concepts
3. **Use glossary extensively** - 293 terms available
4. **Incorporate FAQ content** - 65 questions provide additional context
5. **Add MicroSims** for complex concepts (especially Ch 7-10)
