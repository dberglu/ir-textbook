- Practical AI application examples
- Executive-appropriate language

**Key Limitations:**
- Limited coverage of AI-specific chapters (Chapters 5-12 not yet written)

## Bloom's Taxonomy Distribution

| Level | Actual | Target | Deviation | Assessment |
|-------|--------|--------|-----------|------------|
| Remember | 18% (8) | 20% | -2% | ✓ Excellent |
| Understand | 41% (18) | 30% | +11% | ⚠️ Slightly high |
| Apply | 23% (10) | 25% | -2% | ✓ Good |
| Analyze | 11% (5) | 15% | -4% | ⚠️ Low (content-limited) |
| Evaluate | 5% (2) | 7% | -2% | ⚠️ Low (content-limited) |
| Create | 2% (1) | 3% | -1% | ⚠️ Low (content-limited) |

**Overall Bloom's Score: 20/25**

**Analysis:** Distribution is acceptable for early FAQ version but skews toward lower-order thinking (Remember/Understand = 59%) due to limited chapter content. As more advanced chapters (5-12) are completed, expect natural shift toward Analyze/Evaluate/Create questions about AI implementation, governance design, and transformation strategy.

**Recommendation:** Add 3-5 more Analyze/Evaluate questions once Chapters 3-5 are available.
