### Recommendations for Bloom's Balance

**Add 3-4 "Analyze" questions** comparing/contrasting concepts:
- "How do sentiment analysis and predictive analytics differ in IR applications?"
- "Compare the compliance requirements for AI-generated vs. human-generated IR content"
- "Analyze the tradeoffs between build vs. buy for AI IR solutions"
- "How do institutional and retail investor engagement strategies differ?"

**Convert 3-4 "Understand" to "Apply" questions** by making them more action-oriented:
- Change "What is X?" to "How would you implement X?"
- Change "How does X work?" to "What steps should you take to deploy X?"
