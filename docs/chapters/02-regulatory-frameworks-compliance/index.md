# Regulatory Frameworks and Compliance

## Summary

This chapter provides comprehensive coverage of the regulatory environment governing investor relations and corporate disclosures. You'll master the requirements of Regulation Fair Disclosure (Reg FD), the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), SEC filing requirements, and disclosure controls. The chapter explores material information standards, prevention of selective disclosure, internal control systems, various SEC forms (10-K, 10-Q, 8-K), XBRL reporting, MD&A requirements, risk factor disclosures, forward-looking statements, safe harbor provisions, materiality assessment, disclosure timing rules, quiet periods, trading windows, blackout periods, and insider trading rules. This regulatory foundation is critical for understanding compliance requirements when implementing AI-assisted IR communications in later chapters.
