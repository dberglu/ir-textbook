<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Databases storing large amounts of language data
2. Translation tools for converting between programming languages
3. AI systems trained on vast text datasets enabling human-like language understanding and generation
4. Spell-checking software for long documents
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. Large Language Models are AI systems trained on vast text datasets that enable human-like language understanding and generation. Examples include GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini. These models can write, summarize, analyze, and respond to text in contextually appropriate ways. Option A describes databases, not AI models. Option B describes compilers or transpilers. Option D describes simple text tools, not sophisticated AI systems.

    **Concept Tested:** Large Language Models

    **Bloom's Level:** Remember

    **See:** [Section 2: Generative AI and Large Language Models](index.md#2-generative-ai-and-large-language-models-llms)

#### 5. In prompt engineering, what is the purpose of providing "few-shot examples" to an LLM?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. To reduce the model's processing time
2. To permanently retrain the model
3. To reduce the cost of API calls
4. To show the model the desired output format and style through concrete examples
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **D**. Few-shot examples demonstrate the desired output format and style through concrete examples within the prompt, helping the model understand expectations without retraining. For instance, showing 2-3 examples of how to summarize earnings calls guides the model to produce similar summaries. Option A is incorrect—examples may increase prompt length. Option C mischaracterizes prompting—it doesn't retrain models. Option D may be backwards—longer prompts with examples can increase costs.

#### 6. What distinguishes agentic AI systems from traditional AI applications?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Agentic systems require more data storage
2. Agentic systems are always more expensive
3. Agentic systems can only process text data
4. Agentic systems operate autonomously, making decisions and taking actions without continuous human intervention
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **D**. Agentic AI systems operate autonomously, perceiving their environment, making decisions, and taking actions to achieve goals without continuous human intervention. Unlike traditional AI that responds to specific inputs, agentic systems can plan multi-step workflows and adapt strategies. Option A is irrelevant to the distinction. Option C may or may not be true depending on implementation. Option D is incorrect—agentic systems can be multimodal.

    **Concept Tested:** Agentic AI Systems

    **Bloom's Level:** Understand

#### 7. Your company wants to use an LLM to analyze earnings call transcripts. What is a critical consideration for enterprise LLM deployment?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. LLMs work perfectly without any configuration
2. Implementing governance controls for data privacy, accuracy validation, and usage monitoring
3. LLMs can replace all human IR functions immediately
4. Enterprise LLMs don't require security measures
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Enterprise LLM usage requires implementing governance controls including data privacy protections (preventing sensitive data exposure), accuracy validation (human review of outputs), usage monitoring (tracking what data is processed), and compliance frameworks. Option A is dangerously naive—LLMs require careful configuration. Option C overstates capabilities—LLMs augment, not replace, human expertise. Option D ignores critical security requirements for enterprise data.

    **Concept Tested:** Enterprise LLM Usage

1. Repeatedly showing the same training data
2. An ML approach where systems learn optimal strategies through trial, feedback, and rewards
3. Strengthening computer hardware for AI workloads
4. A technique for compressing large datasets
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Reinforcement learning is an ML approach where systems learn optimal strategies through trial and error, receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. The system explores actions, observes outcomes, and adjusts strategy to maximize cumulative rewards. In IR, this could optimize investor engagement timing or communication strategies. Option A describes data augmentation or repeated training, not RL. Option C relates to infrastructure, not algorithms. Option D describes data compression techniques.

    **Concept Tested:** Reinforcement IR Learning

    **Bloom's Level:** Remember

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. They are only needed during initial setup
2. They replace the need for model validation
3. They guarantee models will work on any future data
4. They provide historical examples that teach ML systems patterns for making predictions
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **D**. Training datasets provide historical examples that teach ML systems patterns, enabling them to make predictions on new data. Quality and representativeness of training data directly impact model performance. Option A is incomplete—models may need retraining with new data. Option C is backwards—validation data (separate from training) is essential. Option D overstates—training on past data doesn't guarantee performance on all future scenarios, especially if conditions change.
