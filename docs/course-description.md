    # Course Description

In an era where artificial intelligence (AI) and big data are redefining capital markets and corporate communications, the investor relations (IR) function stands at a transformative crossroads. AI has evolved from a back-office efficiency tool to a front-line strategic driver — reshaping how companies communicate, analyze data, and engage with the investment community.

This **self-paced executive course** provides a strategic deep dive into leveraging **AI, agentic systems, and data-driven insights** to elevate investor relations practices and outcomes. Designed by seasoned Fortune 100 executives and aligned with **Wharton-caliber rigor**, the curriculum blends cutting-edge market trends with real-world best practices. Participants will gain both a **strategic foundation** and **actionable capabilities** to lead IR in a data-rich, technologically advanced environment.

Participants will explore how AI augments human expertise in IR — enhancing, not replacing, the critical judgment and relationship-building that senior IR professionals provide. Through a combination of interactive case studies, applied exercises, and expert insights, you will learn to harness AI as a supportive tool that empowers more effective investor engagement, communication, and analysis.

From **generative AI co-pilots** drafting earnings reports and shareholder letters, to **machine learning models** parsing investor sentiment, to **agentic AI systems** autonomously gathering and interpreting market intelligence, the course surveys the state-of-the-art in IR innovation.  
Crucially, it also addresses **strategic, ethical, and governance considerations** — ensuring that leaders can deploy AI responsibly in compliance with regulations and corporate values.

## Emergent Best Practices

The curriculum is continually updated to reflect emerging innovations that are reshaping the IR landscape. Participants will examine new frameworks such as the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** — a standard for connecting AI agents securely to live enterprise data and tools — and evaluate how such frameworks can **secure and scale IR operations**.

Real-world case studies drawn from **Fortune 100 companies** illustrate how leading organizations use AI to anticipate investor questions, refine messaging through sentiment analysis, and forecast market reactions. By learning from these examples and expert guest insights, participants will confidently translate theory into actionable strategy, ensuring their IR approach remains **competitive and future-proof** in an evolving environment.
