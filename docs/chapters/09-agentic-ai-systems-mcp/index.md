# Agentic AI Systems and Model Context Protocol

## Summary

This chapter introduces autonomous AI agents and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) standard for secure AI integration. You'll learn about agentic AI systems, autonomous AI agents, agent orchestration, multi-agent coordination, agent-based IR workflows, MCP architecture, MCP security standards, MCP integration paths, agents for data retrieval, integrating live data, AI briefing generation, and automated report tools. These advanced AI capabilities enable IR teams to deploy sophisticated, autonomous workflows that can retrieve data, generate briefings, and coordinate multiple AI agents to handle complex IR tasks.
