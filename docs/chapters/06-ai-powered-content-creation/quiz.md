#### 1. What is the primary strategic advantage of using AI for IR content creation?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. AI augments human capabilities by accelerating drafting while humans provide strategic direction and compliance oversight
2. AI completely replaces human writers, eliminating the need for IR staff
3. AI guarantees perfect compliance with all regulatory requirements
4. AI creates content that never requires review or editing
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **A**. The strategic value of AI content creation centers on augmenting human capabilities—AI accelerates drafting (60-80% time reduction), ensures consistency, and identifies issues, while humans provide strategic direction, regulatory oversight, and final approval. Option B is incorrect—AI assists rather than replaces human judgment. Option C overstates capabilities—AI automates mechanical compliance checks but human legal judgment remains essential. Option D is unrealistic—all AI-generated content requires human review and approval.

#### 2. In a GenAI earnings report workflow, what happens during the "human review" stage?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. AI independently publishes the earnings release without oversight
2. Only the CEO reviews the final document for approval
3. Multiple dimensions are assessed including accuracy, compliance, strategic messaging, and tone appropriateness
4. The document is sent directly to the SEC without internal validation
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. Human review involves multiple critical dimensions: accuracy review (verifying numbers match source systems), compliance review (Reg FD, safe harbor language), strategic review (messaging alignment), and quality review (clarity, tone, readability). This multi-dimensional review ensures AI output meets all requirements before publication. Option A violates oversight principles—AI never publishes without human approval. Option B is insufficient—multiple stakeholders review (IR, legal, finance, executives). Option D is dangerous and non-compliant—internal validation is mandatory.

#### 3. What is a "prompt library" in the context of IR content creation?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. A physical collection of printed templates stored in filing cabinets
2. A curated collection of effective prompts for common IR tasks enabling consistency and knowledge sharing
3. A list of questions analysts might ask during earnings calls
4. A database of historical stock prices and financial metrics
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Prompt libraries constitute curated collections of effective prompts for common IR tasks (earnings releases, call scripts, press releases), enabling consistency, knowledge sharing, and continuous improvement. Organizations build reusable libraries capturing institutional knowledge rather than each team member crafting prompts from scratch. Option A confuses digital prompt libraries with physical template storage. Option C describes Q&A preparation, not prompt libraries. Option D describes financial databases, not AI prompt collections.

    **Concept Tested:** Prompt Libraries

    **Bloom's Level:** Remember

    **See:** [Section 3: Prompt Libraries and Content Templates](index.md#3-prompt-libraries-and-content-templates)

#### 4. Your company's AI system generates an earnings release draft. What should the draft-review-approve workflow prioritize?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Publishing immediately to beat competitors to market
2. Skipping legal review since AI handles compliance automatically
3. Having only one person review to speed up the process
4. Multi-stage review with parallel tracks for accuracy, compliance, strategy, and quality before executive approval
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **D**. Effective draft-review-approve workflows use multi-stage processes with parallel review tracks: accuracy review (IR/Finance verify numbers), compliance review (Legal checks Reg FD and safe harbor), strategic review (IR leadership assesses messaging), and quality review (editing for clarity), followed by sequential executive approvals. This balances AI efficiency with necessary human oversight. Option A sacrifices quality and compliance for speed—dangerous. Option B is incorrect—AI automates mechanical checks but legal review remains essential. Option C creates single-point-of-failure risk and misses multi-dimensional review benefits.

    **Concept Tested:** Draft Review Workflows

    **Bloom's Level:** Apply

#### 5. Which tone dimension is MOST critical when a company misses earnings expectations?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Very high transparency—thoroughly explain causes without evasiveness or defensiveness
2. Overly promotional—emphasize only positive aspects to distract from the miss
3. Extremely casual—use informal language to seem relatable
4. Highly defensive—blame external factors exclusively without acknowledging internal issues
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **A**. When missing earnings expectations, very high transparency is critical—thoroughly explain specific causes, acknowledge issues honestly, and pivot to future plans without evasiveness. This builds trust and maintains credibility during difficult periods. Option B backfires—promotional tone during misses damages credibility and seems disconnected from reality. Option C is inappropriate—casual tone diminishes seriousness of situation. Option D undermines credibility—purely defensive stance without acknowledging any internal factors appears evasive and unaccountable.

#### 6. What does "narrative consistency" mean in IR communications?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Using exactly the same words in every quarterly earnings release
2. Never changing strategic priorities regardless of business evolution
3. Maintaining coherent and aligned messaging across communications and time periods with logical evolution
4. Avoiding all mentions of past performance to focus only on the future
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. Narrative consistency maintains coherent and aligned messaging across different communications (releases, scripts, presentations) and time periods (quarter-to-quarter, year-to-year), with logical evolution reflecting business reality. Strategic themes should persist with explained changes, tone should shift gradually with performance, and messaging should evolve rationally. Option A confuses consistency with rigid repetition—messaging should evolve while maintaining coherence. Option B is inflexible—strategies should adapt to circumstances with explanation. Option D is backwards—consistency requires referencing past performance and connecting it to current narrative.

#### 7. What is the primary purpose of automated compliance review tools for IR content?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. To completely replace legal counsel in all compliance decisions
2. To automate detection of common violations, freeing legal teams to focus on complex judgment calls
3. To guarantee that no compliance issues will ever occur
4. To eliminate the need for any human review of IR materials
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Compliance review tools automate detection of common mechanical violations (missing safe harbor language, potential selective disclosure, consistency issues), freeing legal teams to focus on complex judgment calls rather than routine checking. This "shift left" approach catches issues early. Option A overstates—automated tools handle mechanical checks but can't replace legal judgment on ambiguous situations. Option C is unrealistic—automation reduces but doesn't eliminate compliance risk. Option D is dangerous—human review remains essential for strategic decisions and final approval.

#### 8. An AI system flags this language in a draft earnings release: "We expect revenue growth of 20-25% next year." What compliance issue has likely been detected?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. The percentage range is too wide and needs to be narrowed
2. Revenue growth projections should always be higher than 25%
3. The company is required to provide monthly rather than annual guidance
4. Forward-looking statements require safe harbor language identifying risks and uncertainties
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **D**. Forward-looking statements (using words like "expect," "anticipate," "believe") require specific safe harbor language protecting companies from liability when projections don't materialize. The safe harbor statement must identify the statement as forward-looking and reference specific risk factors (typically in Form 10-K). Option A mischaracterizes—range width reflects business visibility, not a compliance issue. Option B is incorrect—there's no regulatory requirement for minimum growth rates. Option C is wrong—companies choose guidance frequency based on strategy and visibility, not regulatory mandates.

#### 9. When drafting an investor memo, what is the most important compliance consideration to prevent Reg FD violations?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Use only information from public disclosures and cite sources for all factual claims
2. Include as much detailed internal information as possible to be helpful
3. Avoid mentioning the company's SEC filings
4. Share different information with institutional investors than with retail investors
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **A**. To prevent Reg FD selective disclosure violations, investor memos must use ONLY information from public disclosures (SEC filings, earnings releases, presentations, press releases) and cite specific sources for verifiable claims. This ensures no material nonpublic information is shared selectively. Option B violates Reg FD—sharing internal material information with some investors before public disclosure is prohibited. Option C is counterproductive—citing SEC filings demonstrates compliance by referencing public sources. Option D explicitly violates Reg FD by creating selective disclosure between investor types.

#### 10. What characterizes "Level 3: Context-Aware Creation" in AI content maturity?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Human creates outline, AI expands into full draft, human heavily edits
2. Predefined templates with variable fields populated by AI
3. AI accesses historical documents and current data to generate drafts incorporating relevant precedents and maintaining consistency
4. AI ensures alignment across multiple related documents simultaneously
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. Level 3 (Context-Aware Creation) involves AI accessing historical documents and current data to generate drafts that incorporate relevant precedents, maintain consistency with prior communications, and reference appropriate context. This goes beyond simple template filling to intelligent synthesis. Option A describes Level 1 (Assisted Drafting). Option B describes Level 2 (Template-Based Generation). Option D describes Level 4 (Multi-Document Coordination), which remains primarily aspirational for most organizations.

#### 11. Which AI content application has the HIGHEST applicability and frequency for routine IR workflows?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Proxy statements requiring complex legal language
2. FAQ documents with Q&A format ideal for AI generation and regular updates
3. Annual CEO letters requiring unique voice and strategic narrative
4. Investor presentations requiring visual elements and storytelling flow
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. FAQ documents have "very high" AI applicability because the Q&A format is ideal for AI, they're updated regularly (providing frequent value), and they benefit from staying current with latest disclosures. AI can efficiently generate, update, and maintain FAQs by referencing public documents. Option A has low applicability—proxy statements require highly specialized legal language and intensive legal review. Option C has medium applicability—CEO voice and personality are critical, limiting AI's role. Option D has medium applicability—visual elements and strategic storytelling require significant human creativity.

#### 12. A company notices its Q2 earnings release emphasized "AI transformation" prominently, but Q3 barely mentions it. What narrative consistency issue does this create?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. This is perfectly fine as long as the financial numbers are accurate
2. Strategic themes should change every quarter to keep communications fresh
3. Frequent earnings calls automatically prevent any consistency concerns
4. Unexplained theme disappearance signals potential strategic uncertainty or lack of progress to investors
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **D**. When strategic themes appear prominently then disappear without explanation, investors may interpret this as signaling uncertainty, reduced prioritization, or lack of progress on initiatives. Strategic themes should persist across quarters with consistent tracking metrics, and any emphasis shifts should be explained rationally. Option A misses the point—accuracy alone isn't sufficient; messaging consistency matters for credibility. Option B is counterproductive—constantly changing themes creates confusion and undermines strategic narrative. Option C is wrong—call frequency doesn't prevent consistency issues; coherent messaging does.
