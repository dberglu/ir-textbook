AI has evolved from a back-office efficiency tool to a front-line strategic driver \u2014 reshaping how companies communicate, analyze data, and engage with the investment community.</p> <p>This self-paced executive course provides a strategic deep dive into leveraging AI, agentic systems, and data-driven insights to elevate investor relations practices and outcomes. Designed by seasoned Fortune 100 executives and aligned with Wharton-caliber rigor, the curriculum blends cutting-edge market trends with real-world best practices. Participants will gain both a strategic foundation and actionable capabilities to lead IR in a data-rich, technologically advanced environment.</p> <p>Participants will explore how AI augments human expertise in IR \u2014 enhancing, not replacing, the critical judgment and relationship-building that senior IR professionals provide. Through a combination of interactive case studies, applied exercises, and expert insights, you will learn to harness AI as a supportive tool that empowers more effective investor engagement, communication, and analysis.</p> <p>From generative AI co-pilots drafting earnings reports and shareholder letters, to machine learning models parsing investor sentiment, to agentic AI systems autonomously gathering and interpreting market intelligence, the course surveys the state-of-the-art in IR innovation. Crucially, it also addresses strategic, ethical, and governance considerations \u2014 ensuring that leaders can deploy AI responsibly in compliance with regulations and corporate values.</p>"},{"location":"course-description/#emergent-best-practices","title":"Emergent Best Practices","text":"<p>The curriculum is continually updated to reflect emerging innovations that are reshaping the IR landscape. Participants will examine new frameworks such as the Model Context Protocol (MCP) \u2014 a standard for connecting AI agents securely to live enterprise data and tools \u2014 and evaluate how such frameworks can secure and scale IR operations.</p> <p>Real-world case studies drawn from Fortune 100 companies illustrate how leading organizations use AI to anticipate investor questions, refine messaging through sentiment analysis, and forecast market reactions. By learning from these examples and expert guest insights, participants will confidently translate theory into actionable strategy, ensuring their IR approach remains competitive and future-proof in an evolving environment.</p>"},{"location":"course-description/#key-topics-covered","title":"Key Topics Covered","text":""},{"location":"course-description/#1-foundations-of-investor-relations","title":"1.
